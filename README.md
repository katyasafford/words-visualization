# Set Up

1. Pull the project and run `npm install`. 
2. Run `ng serve` to start a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. If you don't have Angular installed globally, you may need to specify the path and run this command like `./node_modules/.bin/ng serve`
3. Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). You will need to have Google Chrome installed to run unit tests. Similarly, if you don't have Angular installed globally, you may need to specify the path like in step#2.
4. Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). If you are already running   `ng serve` command, you may need to specify a different port for e2e tests, so you may need to run them with command `ng e2e --port 3030`. You also will need to have Google Chrome installed to run e2e tests since Chrome is currently set as a default browser for e2e tests.
